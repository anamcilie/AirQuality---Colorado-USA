# AirQuality---Colorado-USA
Open Source Data - Air Quality assessment in Colorado State - US


What's in the Air at Mines?


In Colorado, air pollution regularly surpasses limits due to a combination of human activities, wildfire smoke, and mountain topography trapping pollutants. Air pollution impacts all community members, but disproportionately impacts people with underlying health issues and people who live near sources of pollution, often people of color. To begin to address air quality in our community, the Colorado School of Mines - Green Team joined the IQAir Global Air Quality Network through the deployment of on-campus air quality monitor that provides real-time air quality data to our community, critical information for future air quality projects on campus, and connection to the global air quality research community.
